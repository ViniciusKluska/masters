Basic notation

Statements: A, B, C, . . .

    True/False: all statements are either true or false.

Negation: ¬A 
    ‘not A’     -> Ac = {x ∈ X : x ∉ A}

Conjunction: A ∧ B 
    ‘A and B’   -> A ∩ B

Disjunction: A ∨ B 
    ‘A or B’    -> A U B

Implication: A ⇒ B 
    ‘A implies B’
        -> A is defined as hypothesis or antecedent
        -> B is defined as conclusion.
            A is sufficient condition for B; B is necessary condition for A.

Equivalence: A ⇔ B 
    ‘A if and only if B’ (A iff B, for short)
            A is necessary and sufficient for B; B is necessary and sufficient for A.

Example 1 (¬A) ∧ A ⇔ FALSE.
    (¬(A ∨ B)) ⇔ ((¬A) ∧ (¬B)) De Morgan rule.

Quantifiers

Existential: ∃ 
    ‘There exists’ or ‘There is’

Universal: ∀ 
    ‘For all’ or ‘For every’

Uniqueness: ∃!
    ‘There exists a unique ...’ or ‘There is a unique...’

The colon : and the vertical line |
    ‘such that’

a ∈ S
    ‘a is an element of (belongs to) set S’

Example 2 (Definition of continuity)
f is continuous at x if

(∀ > 0)(∃δ > 0) : (∀y ∈ |y − x| < δ ⇒ |f(y) − f(x)| < )
